  'your other exams and tests:\n' +
  'Heart/Lungs: Regular rate, no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Lungs clear bilaterally.\n' +
  'MSK: Knees, hips, ankles, shoulders and hands: No tenderness and range of motions is normal.\n' +

  'Neuro: Alert and oriented x 3. Sensation, proprioception, and motor strength normal. Gait normal. Rises from chair to standing and gets on and off exam table without difficulty.\n' +
  'Bone mineral density with T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 or Bone mineral density with T-score < or = -2.5.\n' +
  'Lumbar spine T-score = -2.6\n' +
  '•\tFemoral neck T-score = -2.8\n' +

  'DXA scan showed my T-score is -2.6 at the lumbar spine and -2.8 at the femoral neck. What does that mean?\n' +
  'T-score measures your bone density compared to women at peak bone mass (around age 30). A T-score less than -2.5 means you have osteoporosis. The World Health Organization uses this as a cutoff to define osteoporosis and the need for treatment.\n' +

  '•\tFemoral neck BMD = 0.605 g/cm2\n' +
  '•\tFemoral neck T-score = -2.1\n' +
  'Because her DXA shows osteopenia (T-score between - 1.0 and -2.5), she is treatment-naïve, and post-menopausal, a FRAX calculation should be done to see if she is eligible for treatment with anti-osteoporotic drugs.\n' +
